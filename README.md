# ServiceFabricIntro
Built solution after a pluralsight course, now a playground for testing Service Fabric features.

## Description
This project was started as a baseline of my knowledge for Service Fabric.  

It was build from this course from Pluralsight:
[Understanding the Programming Models of Azure Service Fabric](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/azure-service-fabric-programming-models/table-of-contents)

Notable initial changes are that, instead of .NET Core, Asp.Net Web API 2 was used.  This was to test compatibility with older code.  A walkthrough of how to do this can be found [here](https://blog.geist.no/azure-service-fabric-introduction-part-2-our-endpoint-a-webapi-based-stateless-service/).

Other than that, there have been some small additions/changes.  Mostly, I've added a few extra endpoint verbs to be able to manage stuff while debugging.

### Disclaimer
This is a sandbox and none of it has any business in production.  I wouldn't even use this as a starter project.  Refer to Microsoft Documentation!
